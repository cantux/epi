Now we are at the onsite stages.

1) Read online on some insights of difference between on-site and phone stages
2) Identify all the categories of problems.
    * Problem with this is that it will take huge amount of time to go through everything 
    * But there is no way around it.
3) Find all the questions you are not comfortable with.
    * Attack some of the problems that you haven't fully swindled with.


We will be taking vigorous notes during the first week. I don't want to let anything slip through.
